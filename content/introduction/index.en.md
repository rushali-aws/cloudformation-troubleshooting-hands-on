Welcome to the CloudFormation Best Practices workshop!

In this session, we’ll explore the essential principles and techniques for managing your AWS infrastructure using CloudFormation.

To make the most out of CloudFormation, we’ll focus on two key best practices through practical scenarios:
	
   * `Scenario 1:` Use Change Sets Before Updating Stacks – Before applying updates to your CloudFormation stacks, it’s crucial to preview the changes to avoid potential disruptions. In this scenario, we’ll focus on the practice of creating and reviewing change sets, enabling you to validate modifications before they impact your infrastructure.
   * `Scenario 2:` Avoid Out-of-Band Changes – Making manual, out-of-band changes to your infrastructure can cause drift, where the actual state of resources diverges from what is defined in your CloudFormation template. This scenario emphasizes the importance of adhering to infrastructure-as-code principles, ensuring that all changes are tracked and managed through CloudFormation to avoid unexpected issues.
   
By the end of this workshop, you’ll have practical insights into how to keep your CloudFormation stacks stable, reliable, and easy to manage by avoiding common pitfalls and adopting proven best practices.
